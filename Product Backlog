PROBLEM STATEMENT

Today, people have countless numbers of device passwords, website logins, credit cards, PINs, licenses, and a wide variety of other hard-to-memorize personal information. Keeping and remembering all of these is an extremely difficult task, especially considering that in order to be safe, each one of these items must be lengthy and complex. Additionally, people often need to quickly share these bits of info with those you trust. A password manager will easily store and track all of these items in a clean and simple interface, requiring only a single master password to quickly access a user's stored information. This will eliminate the need to memorize a multitude of information, and allow swift, safe sharing.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Other password managers exist today, however, they come with their own set of limitations. Many competitor managers have a strong dependence on an outside server and often require a user to buy the software. While there are free options on the market, ours is unique in that no data from the user will ever be stored on an offsite server and all passwords and login information will be backed up locally. Given this feature, users will only have to worry about keeping their personal computer secure, instead of worrying about security that is out of their control. Furthermore, other managers are very limited with their data options. Our project will provide a vast amount of different information types without requiring a premium account. Lastly, Sentinel Data Vault will provide the capability to quickly and safely share information with trusted users.
