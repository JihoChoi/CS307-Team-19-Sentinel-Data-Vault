Problem Statement
Today, people have countless numbers of device passwords, website logins, credit cards, and personal addresses. Remembering all of these is an extremely difficult task, especially considering that in order to be safe, each one of these items must be lengthy and complex. A password manager easily stores and tracks all of these items in a clean and simple interface, requiring only a single master password to quickly access a user's stored information. Existing systems are convoluted, overly expensive, and dependent on servers that are vulnerable to being hacked. Our system aims to store all data, simply, securely, and locally while being free and open source.


Project Objectives
* To store passwords, logins, and payment information securely on the user’s computer.
* To be able to store multiple users’ passwords on the same computer and make them easily accessible to their owners.
* To be able to generate secure passwords for the user and identify weak passwords.


Stakeholders
* Users: anyone with multiple device passwords, website logins, and payment methods
* Developers: Jiho Choi, Zhaoji Jiang, Adam Petty, Dingfu Sun, Thomas Worns


Deliverables
* A frontend desktop Java application that will run on Mac OSX, Linux, or Windows to display users’ stored data
* A backend system to encrypt and retrieve stored information and handle the accounts
* A database that stores the user data.
