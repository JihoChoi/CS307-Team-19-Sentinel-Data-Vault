The Sentinel Data Vault allows the user to select an avatar picture.
This is done by clicking the \"Settings\" button in the main screen after logging in.
In the settings window, clicking on the \"Change Avatar\" button brings up a window
that allows for the choosing of an avatar.
Once the avatar has been selected, the main screen will display the selected avatar.
